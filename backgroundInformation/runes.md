GETTING STARTED WITH RUNES

WHAT ARE RUNES?
Runes allow Bitcoin transactions to etch, mint, and transfer Bitcoin-native digital commodities. While every inscription is unique, every unit of a rune is the same and interchangeable. It is basically a token protocol on Bitcoin.

What is Rune Blaster?
Rune Blaster is a tool designed for efficiently minting Runes in bulk.

1. It operates fully non-custodial, ensuring that your Bitcoin remains in your wallet at all times.
2. With the capability to execute up to 25 chained transactions in a batch, it enhances efficiency.
3. Upon minting, Runes are received in a consolidated UTXO, streamlining the process.
4. Payment for the entire batch can be made using larger UTXOs.
5. Exclusive availability initially at @XverseApp, with @MEonBTC soon to join.

At launch, Rune Blaster is accessible to @TheWizardsOfOrd holders, with plans for public availability shortly after the halving, contingent on successful operations.

While Rune Blaster offers a more economical alternative to using a node with the standard ord wallet, we advise maintaining a node. Despite its advantages, Rune Blaster, being a web tool, may encounter scaling limitations during periods of high demand.
