What is parent/child? Parent-child? What is Parent Child? On-chain provenance?

Provenance / Parent Child Inscriptions
The owner of an inscription can create child inscriptions, trustlessly establishing the provenance of those children on-chain as having been created by the owner of the parent inscription. This can be used for collections, with the children of a parent inscription being members of the same collection.
Children can themselves have children, allowing for complex hierarchies. For example, an artist might create an inscription representing themselves, with sub inscriptions representing collections that they create, with the children of those sub inscriptions being items in those collections.
