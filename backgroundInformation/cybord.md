What is CYBORD? CBRC-20?
CBRC-20 is an Ordinals coin standard that uses the Meta Data of inscriptions to manage the protocol, rather than inscription content which costs more fee wise to inscribe on Bitcoin.
"Why CBRC-20s vs. BRC-20s?"
"But wait," you ask, "doesn't Bitcoin already have BRC-20 for tokens?"

Yes, but that community has decided to 'freeze' the protocol, which means you can trade them but it's not going to receive updates

BRC-20 was quite inefficient. CBRC-20 is more efficient - and more flexible
So with CBRC-20 vs. BRC-20 you get:

- reduced inscription codes
- simplified indexing (easier for devs to build tools)
- support for *any* filetype
- better composability with upcoming protocols
