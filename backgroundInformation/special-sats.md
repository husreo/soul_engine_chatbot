SPECIAL SATS

What are the sat rarities? What are rare sats?
Bitcoin has periodic events, some frequent, some more uncommon, and these naturally lend themselves to a system of rarity depending on the time the satoshis were mined.

Special sats, “rare sats”, exotic sats, are all sats with a specified attribute due to its history with the block, or timeline, or event. Here is some info about the specific details of current known satribute categories:

Satributes: 
Every inscription is tied to an individual sat which is used to track ownership of the inscription. This means that every Ordinal "NFT" is a combination of an inscription (the file) and a sat (how ownership is tracked). While the majority of people mostly pay attention to what the file and what the art looks like, many Ordinal collectors also care about the sat being inscribed on. When an inscription is on a "special" or "old" sat, the inscriptions will be assigned them "satributes" by custom sites or "charms" by the ord client itself so that collectors can easily filter for the inscriptions on interesting sats.

List of Sats:
- Uncommon Sats: These are the first sat of each block. With about 6.93 million of these, they are a bit more special than the Common ones. They represent the beginning of a new block and are thus slightly harder to find.

- Rare Sats: These are the first sat of each difficulty adjustment period. There are about 3,437 of these, making them even more scarce. They mark significant points in Bitcoin's timeline, as difficulty adjustments happen about every two weeks to ensure the stability of the Bitcoin network.

-Epic Sats: These are the first sat of each halving epoch. There are about 5 of these, making them quite rare indeed. Halving epochs occur approximately every four years, and these sats mark these significant events. The next Bitcoin halving will give rise to another Epic satoshi. The first epic sat was purchased for 33.3 BTC has the rune EPIC•EPIC•EPIC•EPIC attached to it (https://magiceden.io/runes/EPIC%E2%80%A2EPIC%E2%80%A2EPIC%E2%80%A2EPIC) which was achieved through massive ordinals community effort.

- Legendary Sats: These are the first sat of each cycle. The number of these is yet to be determined, depending on the length and number of cycles in Bitcoin's history. These sats mark the beginning of new cycles, making them significant markers in Bitcoin's timeline.

- Mythic Sats: The Mythic sat is the first sat of the genesis block. There is only one of these, making it the rarest of all sats. This satoshi marks the very beginning of Bitcoin and holds immense historical significance.

- Nakamoto Sats: These are sats mined by Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The total supply of these sats is about 110 trillion. This represents 5.24% of the total Bitcoin supply.

- Palindrome Sats: These are the sats where the numbers read the same backward as forwards. The total supply of these sats is estimated to be around ~121 million.

- Pizza Sats: These sats are associated with the first documented purchase with Bitcoin—10,000 BTC for two pizzas. The total supply of these sats is 1 trillion.

- Pizza Palindromes: These are palindrome sats associated with the first documented purchase with Bitcoin—10,000 BTC for two pizzas. The total supply of these sats is roughly 3 million.

- Vintage Sats: These sats are from the first 1,000 block range, dating from January 04, 2009, to January 19, 2009. The total supply of these sats is 100 billion.
- Vintage Palindromes: These are palindrome sats from the first 1,000 block range, dating from January 04, 2009, to January 19, 2009. The total supply of these sats is roughly 6 million.

- Block 9 Sats: These are the oldest sats in circulation. The total supply of these sats is 5 billion.
- Block 9 Palindromes: These are palindrome sats from the oldest block in circulation. The total supply of these sats is roughly 1,100, making them the rarest historical sat you can find.

- Block 78 Sats: These are the first block mined by someone other than Satoshi, mined by Hal Finney. The total supply of these sats is 5 billion.

- Block 78 Palindromes: These are palindrome sats from the first block mined by someone other than Satoshi, mined by Hal Finney. The total supply of these sats is roughly 1,100.

-First Transaction Sats: These sats were transferred from Satoshi to Hal Finney on January 12, 2009, in block 170. The total supply of these sats is 1 billion.

- Block 286 Palindromes: These are palindrome sats from block 286. The total supply of these sats is also roughly 1,100.

- Rarity
  Humans are collectors, and since satoshis can now be tracked and transferred, people will naturally want to collect them. Ordinal theorists can decide for themselves which sats are rare and desirable, but there are some hints…

  Bitcoin has periodic events, some frequent, some more uncommon, and these naturally lend themselves to a system of rarity. These periodic events are:

  Blocks: A new block is mined approximately every 10 minutes, from now until the end of time.

  Difficulty adjustments: Every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks, the Bitcoin network responds to changes in hashrate by adjusting the difficulty target which blocks must meet in order to be accepted.

  Halvings: Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the amount of new sats created in every block is cut in half.

  Cycles: Every six halvings, something magical happens: the halving and the difficulty adjustment coincide. This is called a conjunction, and the time period between conjunctions a cycle. A conjunction occurs roughly every 24 years. The first conjunction should happen sometime in 2032.

This gives us the following rarity levels:

  common: Any sat that is not the first sat of its block
  uncommon: The first sat of each block
  rare: The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period
  epic: The first sat of each halving epoch
  legendary: The first sat of each cycle
  mythic: The first sat of the genesis block

- Rare Satoshi Supply
Total Supply
  common: 2.1 quadrillion
  uncommon: 6,929,999
  rare: 3437
  epic: 32
  legendary: 5
  mythic: 1
Current Supply
  common: 1.9 quadrillion
  uncommon: 808,262
  rare: 369
  epic: 3
  legendary: 0
  mythic: 1
  At the moment, even uncommon satoshis are quite rare. As of this writing, 745,855 uncommon satoshis have been mined - one per 25.6 bitcoin in circulation.

SPECIAL SATS HUNTING/HUNTING FOR SATS/SAT HUNTING
There are sites such as Saturn (https://twitter.com/Saturn_btc) that allow you to input your BTC address and scan your wallet for special sats.

If you wish for manual sat control via Sparrow in order to extract these sats, you must use the ord client that is indexed with sats or follow the guides made by goated community member Franken
