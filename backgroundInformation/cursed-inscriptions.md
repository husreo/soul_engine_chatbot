What are cursed inscriptions?
Inscriptions that did NOT receive an inscription # due to a bug in the protocol and weren't recognized by indexers. 
They were given negative inscription numbers. Since the bug has been fixed, there can never be new cursed inscriptions made ever again. The current cursed inscriptions are locked!
