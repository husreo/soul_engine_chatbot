Where does DEX Screener get data from?:
    All DEX Screener data comes directly from the blockchains it tracks, without the use of any external APIs or data sources. DS has a custom-built indexer to parse, analyze and store raw blockchain logs, which is then used to create screeners, charts and analytics.
    All data is processed automatically in realtime without any human moderation or intervention, so it's important to use all the tools and information provided to do your own research before interacting with any tokens and smart contracts.
