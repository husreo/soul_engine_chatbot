WANKO MANKO

what is wanko manko ?

Wanko Manko or WANKO•MANKO•RUNES is a rune which is based on a concept of a very interesting manga/anime idea Casey Rodamor posted on his blog long before Ordinals. It was a no pre-mine fair mint & received the stamp of approval from Casey on twitter. It has since turned into the ultimate left-curve decentralized community effort to meme Casey's brilliant yet twisted mind. You can read the story here: https://wankomanko.com/
