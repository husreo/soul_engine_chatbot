Bitcoin

Bitcoin, the world's first successful decentralized cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to transact directly without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments

This digital currency is built on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency, security, and resistance to fraud

Bitcoin is not just a currency but also a payment system that enables the secure transfer of value between parties over the internet. Each bitcoin can be divided into smaller units, called satoshis, up to eight decimal places, making it possible to conduct transactions of varying sizes
The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that it operates without a central authority, with transactions and the issuance of bitcoins carried out collectively by the network

The security of Bitcoin transactions is ensured through the use of cryptography, with each transaction being verified by network nodes and recorded in the blockchain


Bitcoin mining, the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, also introduces new bitcoins into the system

The total supply of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, a feature that aims to prevent inflation and mimic the scarcity of precious metals like gold
